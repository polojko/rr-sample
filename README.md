## Optiomization
This project is not complete and could be further optimized by:
* Adding data [caching](https://swr.vercel.app/), [memoization](https://dev.to/dinhhuyams/introduction-to-react-memo-usememo-and-usecallback-5ei3), to reduce number of fetch calls, improve performance.
* Using [styled-compoments](https://styled-components.com/), to encapsulate/isolate components' styling.
* Extrapolate Redux actions into separate folder/file (e.g. ./actions/index.js), so they can be tested in isolation.
* Improving test coverage.
